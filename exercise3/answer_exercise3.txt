1. Look at the code in Noise.cpp and implement the code in Python. Also, print the results for different noise values in the Gaussian case, mean = 0, 5, 10, 20 and sigma = 0, 20, 50, 100 and for the salt-and-pepper case, pa = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.4 and pb = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.4.

Python code is provided in folder exercise3.


2. Change the kernel sizes for all the filters with all different values for noises and print the results for 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 kernels. Comment on the results. Which filter seems to work ”better” for images with salt-and-pepper noise and gaussian noise?

The Gaussian filter works better for Gaussiannoise images and the Median filter works better for Salt-and-pepper images. With the kernel increase, the results become more indistinct.
